# Visualization of Historical Weather Patterns in Galesburg (Knox County) Illinois and Correlation with Crop Yield
by Kelli Davies

This project is divided into two parts:

## I. Historical Temperature Trends
In the first part, the daily record highs and lows throughout the year from 1900 to 2017 are analyzed. Record temperatures that were achieved recently (the last 8 years) are annotated. The relative frequency of these new records is calculated. There appears to be a disproportionate amount of record highs in the last 8 years of the data.

The average temperature per month for each year is plotted for both average lows and average highs. The large variability from one year to another precludes trends, if any, from being discerned. The averages highs and lows are then replotted using an average from a sliding ten year window and the averages for the past 20 years vs all data are calculated. From the average lows, it looks like there is potentially an increase in temperature in more recent years. From the average highs, there is no discernible trend in average daily high across the data. See the conclusion section at the end for additional discussion.

## II. Correlation between Weather and Crop Yield 
This section analyzes correlation between monthly temperature/precipitation metrics and soy/corn crop yields in the Knox County/Galesburg, IL area. The monthly weather metrics are aggregated by quarter to generate statistics for different phases of the agricultural growth cycle. The information is combined with yearly crop yield data to understand what metrics are associated with greater corn and soy yields.

The soy and corn yields did not strongly correlate with each other, and each displayed weak to moderate correlation values with distinct metrics. For soy, rainfall was associated with crop yield. Consistent rain (e.g., more days with precipitation) was more important than the total amount of rainfall. For corn, temperature was important. Higher temperatures in Q3 (summer, growing season) were negatively correlated with yields, indicating mild summers as favorable, and higher temperatures in Q4 (fall, harvest time) were negatively correlated, indicating warmer (milder) temperatures during this time as favorable. See the summary and conclusion sections for additional discussion.
